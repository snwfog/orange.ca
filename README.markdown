# Orange.ca (Personal Website)

__Description__: This is a website that I have created for myself during Summer 2011. I have made a PHP portal and database allowing for login and posting blog entries.

The reason why I have not publish this website is because it only supports Chrome since I was toying with a lot of CSS3 properties. In addition, the site is not very well optimized, as I did not had the time.

Since the end of 2011, I've decided to build a simpler and iPhone compatible website.
